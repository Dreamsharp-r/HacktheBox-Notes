manually putting in a php file did not yield a connection  
-Inputted the wrong IP (tun0 IP)  
Using metasploit yielded a connection however you have to set the LHOST to your vpn connection at tun0.

once shell created could not upgrade shell using any of the commands listed.  
-Restarted the connection and it worked  
Decided to list all the commands that were available then go to the root directory and use the command search to find the file user.txt
